# wiki-viewer
This is a web app that, using the MediaWiki API, allows users to enter a search term and have 10 Wikipedia entries returned to them, complete with short descriptions of the pages and links to the articles. It was made to the specifications of Free Code Camp which canbe viewed [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer).
